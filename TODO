Radial caclculation/sort (?) not working when dragging items.

"auto close" sliding menu after *successful* load/save (help?).

Fill in help file.

Radar files should use '.radar', open/save dialogues should filter for same.

On start up should load the last file viewed.

Open dialogue should validate input files.

Optimize margins in print mode (landscape).

Cleanup tooltip/mouseover display.

Label radar "bands": Hold, Assess, Trial, Adopt.

Variable size dots.

Need cleaner separation of radar and chrome app components, want to reuse radar elsewhere.

Change dot text centering method to work with Firefox.

Consider using standard navicon/hamburger menu icon.


General clean up, formatting commenting, variable and module names in code!
