        double "<<" indicator.</p>
        
        <p>Next to each quadrant is a legend listing the technologies in that quadrant.
        The legend gives an abbreviation that identifies the technology 
        and the technology name. The legend entries are sorted by the distance from the center of the radar.
        Items at the top are closest to the center. <b>NOTE!</b> The application does not prevent
