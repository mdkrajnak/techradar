    <p>The initial view shows a radar and a legend with a list of technologies that appear in the radar.</p>

    <p>An empty radar just shows the list of 4 quadrants.</p>

    <p>The legend has an abbreviated name that serves as a key and appears on top of the radar blip for that technology on the radar.</p>

    <p>Entries in the legend are grouped by quadrant and sorted closest to center to farthest.</p>

    <p>Technology names and legend keys are not guaranteed to be unique. Users must edit the names if they want them to be unique.</p>

    <p>Click on the title, quadrant name, or technology name to edit it.</p>

    <p>Click on an existing target on the radar and drag to relocate it.</p>

    <p>Click anywhere on the radar to create a new technology entry.</p>

    <ul>
    <li>It will appear with a default name, in the correct place in the legend.</li>
    <li>The name can be changed by clicking on it in the legend.</li>
    </ul>
