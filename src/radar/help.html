        <p>Adjacent to each quadrent is legend listing the technologies in that quadrent.
        The legend gives a key, an abbrevated string that identifies the technology,
        and the technology name. <b>NOTE!</b> The application does not prevent users from
        entering the same technology name more than once.</p>

        <p>The entries in the legend are sorted by the distance from the center of the radar.
        Items at the top are closest to the center.</p>

        <p>Across the top of the radar is the radar title and on the right is the open menu
        double "<<" indicator</p>
